# Traffic Light Controller with Arduino ThinkerCard

This project utilizes Arduino ThinkerCard to control a traffic light system. The system simulates the behavior of traffic lights at an intersection.

## Features

- Emulates the operation of a traffic light system with red, yellow, and green lights for cars and pedestrians.
- Provides customizable timing for each phase of the traffic light cycle.
- Simple and intuitive interface for configuring the traffic light timings.

## Requirements

- Arduino IDE installed on your computer.
- Arduino ThinkerCard board.
- LEDs for simulating traffic lights (red, yellow, and green for cars and pedestrians).
- Jumper wires for connecting components.

## Setup

1. Connect the LEDs for cars and pedestrians to the appropriate pins on the Arduino ThinkerCard board.
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the board using the Arduino IDE.
3. Once uploaded, the traffic light system will start operating according to the default timings.

## Usage

- Adjust the timing parameters in the Arduino sketch to customize the duration of each traffic light phase.
- Monitor the behavior of the traffic lights to ensure they follow the desired pattern.
- Experiment with different timing configurations to simulate various traffic scenarios.
